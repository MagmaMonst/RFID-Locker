# RFID-Locker

This project was made using a cardboard box and a rfid enabled lock. the items used were - MFRC522 RFID sensor, Arduino Uno, L298 motor driver and a dc gear motor. when the correct UID is scanned, the lock opens and allows access to the box for a short amount of time. The RFID library by Miguel Balboa was used.
